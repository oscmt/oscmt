# OSCMT - an Open Source Case Management Tool

This repository contains the project for my Bachelor's Thesis at [HS Esslingen](https://hs-esslingen.de) under Prof. Dr.-Ing. [Harald Melcher](https://hs-esslingen.de/~melcher) and [SySS GmbH](https://syss.de) under Dr. Klaus Tichmann.

## Background
The goal of my thesis was to create a case management software for digital forensics cases. After we looked at current software solutions we decided to create a software solution with the Django framework in Python 3.4. This repository is the result.

## Content
This repository contains the clean version of the software, ready for your use if you want to.

## Installation
Use the ansible playbook I provided in playbooks

## Call for Participation
If you have an improvement for the software please throw me a pull request.
